    <h1>Our Program</h1>
    <h2>No treadmills, yoga mats or dumbbells</h2>
    <p class="lead">Because our program is modeled after BUD/S, the training course used by U.S. Navy SEALs, our program is held outdoors at locations such as; local parks; the beach, universities, and national monuments.</p>
	
  <p>Classes are held <strong>regardless of weather conditions</strong> (except lightning), Monday through Friday. Locations vary daily. Duty stations (where to report for class) are posted on our website one week in advance.<p>


	
	<h3>A safe, fun and intense workout</h3>
	<p>Our Fitness Training program is <strong>open to men and women of all ages (15+)</strong> and levels of fitness. The training is designed to push you beyond what you think is possible. A training session might include push-ups on a kayak or in a foot of snow, pull-ups, and sit-ups. Other workouts include paddling across a river, running through a stream, curling a log or a run through a park.
	<p>Our <strong>instructors treat each member with respect</strong>, regardless of fitness level. Members are expected to encourage other members to push through a tough exercise. As an important member of a team, you will learn to push yourself beyond your limits and to leave no one behind.
	<p>On your first day of training, you will be given a test to scrutinize your current level of fitness and <strike> given an induction haircut</strike>. After your first month, we'll issue you an official SEAL Team Physical Training t-shirt -- you've got to earn this.</p>

    <h1>Best hour of the<br>
     day, hands down</h2>
    
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <blockquote>I've really enjoyed my first week at SEAL Team Physical Training. I recently stopped competitive swimming and had been looking for something to help get me back into shape. I was not enjoying the gym. I like waking up every morning not knowing what to expect.<br>
   <small>Michael A.</small> </blockquote>
    
    <blockquote>The workout is the most creative program I have ever been apart of. It's amazing how simple body weight exercises can become so difficult when compounded one after another. Each day I try and push myself harder and have hit the wall multiple times. I get into my car each morning exhausted and drenched in sweat but I am sad its over and I canâ€™t wait to get back the next day.<br>
    <small>Melissa B.</small>
    </blockquote> 

<blockquote>All I can say is wow, what a week!  On the first day I wasn't sure what to expect, but as a former U.S. Army medic I thought it would be similar to regular army PT. Boy, was I wrong! This is amped up Basic Training PT! The instructors are outstanding while demonstrating professionalism in their knowledge and demeanor. There certainly is a "esprit de corp" atmosphere and the civilian class members should realize they are receiving a true taste of military lifestyle."<br>
    <small>Ollie M.</small>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>I've been training for elite military service for 4 years.  At SEAL Team Physical Training, I have not only gotten in the best shape of my life, but I also developed incredible leadership, and communication skills with the help of John McGuire and instructors. It is amazing how this training helps those new to fitness and the more elite athletes.<br>
    <small>Sean P.</small>
    </blockquote> 
  
  <blockquote>My doctor told me my blood pressure was dangerously high and, if I didn't do something about it, I'd have to start taking medication. It's been 3 months since I joined up, and my blood pressure is lower than it has been since before college. I'm not the fastest runner in the group, and I still struggle with atomic sit-ups. That said, my doctor is surprised and very pleased, as am I.
